<h1>Welcome to my page!</h1>

<p>I am a 17 year old senior at Lewis and Clark Career Center and Francis Howell North High. I am aspiring Aerospace Engineer who wants a coding background.

In my free time I love to excerise and play Super Smash Bros Ultimate! I also play volleyball because I am a REALLY tall person.</p>
